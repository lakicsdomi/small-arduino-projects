# Small Arduino Projects

Welcome to the **Small Arduino Projects** repository! This repository contains various small projects created using the **Elaoo UNO R3 Ultimate Starter Kit**. These projects demonstrate the use of different sensors, modules, and components commonly used in Arduino-based electronics.

## Projects in This Repository

### 1. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
   - **Description**: A project to read and display temperature and humidity values using a DHT11 sensor and an LED dot matrix display. The display visually represents temperature, and debugging output shows temperature and humidity values in the serial monitor.
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrates how to interface sensors with Arduino, process their inputs, and provide both visual and debugging outputs. I also wanted to check the temperature and humidity in my room during winter. :)
   - **Status**: Fully functional.

### 2. **Parking Sonar**
   - **Description**: A parking sensor system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the vehicle and obstacles. It provides:
       - **Audio Feedback**: A buzzer that emits sounds based on the distance.
       - **Visual Feedback**: An LED dot matrix display that visually represents the distance.
   - **Components Used**:
       - Ultrasonic Sensor (SR04)
       - MAX7219 Dot Matrix Module
       - Passive Buzzer
   - **Features**:
       - Real-time distance measurement with visual and audio feedback.
       - Adjustable brightness for the LED dot matrix display.
       - Intermittent or constant buzzer sounds based on proximity.
   - **Status**: Fully functional.
