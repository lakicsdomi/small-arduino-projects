## Projects in This Repository

### 1. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
   - **Description**: A simple project to read and display temperature and humidity values.
   - **Purpose**: Learn how to interface sensors with Arduino and process their inputs.
   - **Status**: Currently includes the basic setup for further development.

   **File**: [`temperature_and_humidity.ino`](https://github.com/lakicsdomi/small-arduino-projects/blob/main/temperature_and_humidity.ino)

### 2. **Parking Sonar**
   - **Description**: A parking sensor system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the vehicle and obstacles. It provides:
       - **Audio Feedback**: A buzzer that emits sounds based on the distance.
       - **Visual Feedback**: An LED dot matrix display that visually represents the distance.
   - **Components Used**:
       - Ultrasonic Sensor (SR04)
       - MAX7219 Dot Matrix Module
       - Passive Buzzer
   - **Features**:
       - Real-time distance measurement with visual and audio feedback.
       - Adjustable brightness for the LED dot matrix display.
       - Intermittent or constant buzzer sounds based on proximity.
   - **Status**: Fully functional.
